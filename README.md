Functions as objects

1) Go to http://codingbat.com/python and complete List 1,2 and String 1,2. If you find them tough, start with Warmup 1 and 2 sections.

2) Write three decorator functions with each modifying other functions in different ways. 

3) Learn about variable length arguements from section 11.6 to complete the challenge below:

Write a function called printf(). There is one positional argument, a format string. The rest are variable arguments that need to be displayed to standard output based on the values in the format string, which allows the special string format operator directives such as %d, %f, etc. Hint: The solution is trivialthere is no need to implement the string operator functionality, but you do need to use the string format operator ( % ) explicitly.
